Design A Full Android App With Flutter.

It's a project in progress :)

1- We use the Parallax API to create few pages.

2- We use the goRouter API to manage the routing of the app .

3- We use the goRouter API to assign for each parallax page to navigate to a certain page that we assign.

4- We use the Provider API to handle the fetched data from the database and push to any page.

5- We use the Postgresql database , we use 2 way for the database:

    a- We use model class to connect the app to the database.

    b- We use the Supabase cloud framework .
